# JemStep

## Overview and Origin

* Jemstep was founded in 2008

* The founding members are

    - Kevin Cimring
    - Matthew Rennie
    - Michael Blumenthal

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    Originally JemStep was an online tool that provided advice on improving ones mutual fund and ETF holdings. Think of it as a combination between Mint.com and Morningstar.com - However the key difference from Morningstar is that their advice is customized to your specific preferences. The weighting of different factors changes with your answers to the topics covered by their "goal preference" survey:

    * Demographics: Age, time to retirement, etc.
    * Risk tolerance: Common risk-questionnaire survey questions about return vs. volatility
    * Fees, Taxes, & Income: Sensitivity to fees, taxes and gains, preference for income vs. total return
    * Fund preferences: Active vs. passive, manager tenure, loads, etc.
    * ETF preferences: Liquidity (volume) preferences, bid/ask spread sensitivity

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    Jemstep was accuired by Invesco in 2016. Prior to that Caleo Capital was a major investor. 100% of management and employees transitioned to Invesco Ltd. after the accuisition and is managed as a separate independent subsidary. Jemstep leverages Invesco for non-core support such as HR, legal, compliance, IT facilities, accounting, project management, and investment solutions.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

     from their website, their mission statement states:

     > Our mission is to assist financial institutions and advisors in serving their clients through an integrated digital platform that enhances advisor engagement with clients and prospects.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    - Jemsteps intended customers are banks, insurers, credit unions, and broker-dealers. The company advisor platform, Jemstep Advisor Pro, helps investment advisors scale their businesses through harnessing the practices of robo-technology for client engagement, onboarding, and servicing. Jemstep Advisor Pro integrates with firms such as Orion, Salesforce, DocuSign and others to help advisors utilize best-of-breed software providers for execution and back-end processes.

    - Their competitors, from a Robo-perspective include
        - Betterment
        - MarketRiders
        - Motif Investing
        - SigFig
        - Wealthfront

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

    From a recent Engineer Job Posting I've identified te following technologies:

    - *Scala* for development, with a strong focus on Functional Programming while still incorporating some aspects of Object-Oriented development.
    - Concurrency Toolkit: Akka
    - Web Framework: Play, React, Redux
    - Source control: Git
    - Database: MongoDB and Redis
    - Chef (implies Ruby) and associated tooling
    - AWS (API, cloudformation, console, CLI)
    - Data structure languages, including XML and Json
    - Ubuntu Linux and other distributions (system administration)
    - Continuous Integration systems

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

    - Investment Advice
    - Robo Advising

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    - Better advice, targeted to people's individuals' needs and risk profile

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

    - Wealthfront
    - SigFig
    - Betterment
    - MarketRiders

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    Since Jemstep pivoted and is now offering white label services to banks and advisors, I haven't been able to find any concrete examples of the company's reach in the industry. However I have learned that they continue to integrate with other leaders in the industry, most recently with Bank of New York Mellon. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    I was not able to pull metrics like installations, or even know which banks are using the platform.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

    JemStep, so far as I'm aware is unique in this specific offering.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?

    Their current offering is pretty amazing as it is, I assume they could break into other tradable products like cryptocurency.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    We are are at an inflection point with regards to cryptocurrencies, at least I think so. Either it will "happen" and be addopted, or governments will criminalize it, and it will be pushed further to the dark web.
